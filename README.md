# Natour-Project
This project was built as practice from the Advanced CSS AND SASS from Jonas SCHMEDTMANN.
In this practice project, I learnt the following:
* Advanced Sass
* Implementation of the 7-1 CSS Architecture
* How to use the BEM better
* The float layout which was in use before flex and grid.
